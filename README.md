### Challenge written report

In the month of June the maximum tempature will be 85 degrees celsius. The minimum in June will be 64 degrees celsius. June will be a hot month but will never exceed 90 and fall below 60 degrees celsius. In the eyes of the peopele this be a cool summer with a few hot days.

In the month of july the maxinmum temputare will be 83 degrees celsius. The minimum in July will be 56 degrees celsius. Like June the month of July will experinces some hot day but there will be a few chilly days. The month of july in the view of the people is not deem a extreme hot month but a mixture of hot and chill.

Other than using describe function to hightlight the months of June and July tempatures there are other ways. We could have created two new dataframes and use the t-test to find tmin, tmax, etc. This type of code is longer but gives us answers and figures which can back up the question asked.

To futher the anaylsist gathering tools is to put the data in a .plot line graph. This will help show and compare key statical data so the reader can detrimine the key components to share to the client,
